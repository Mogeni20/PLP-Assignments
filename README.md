#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
•	Software engineering is the structured application of engineering principles to software creation, testing, and maintenance.
Importance in the Tech Industry:
•	Enhances software reliability and security.
•	Promotes efficiency through structured development approaches.
•	Lowers costs and development time with proper planning.
•	Facilitates innovation and scalability for businesses.
2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering
•	1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering – Formally introduced software engineering as a field to address inefficiencies in software development.
•	Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1970s–80s) – Improved modularity and code reusability with languages like C++ and Java.
•	Agile Manifesto (2001) – Marked the transition from rigid Waterfall methodologies to more flexible, iterative development approaches.
3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
•	Requirement Analysis – Identifying project needs.
•	Planning – Developing a roadmap and estimating resources.
•	Design – Structuring system architecture and user interface.
•	Implementation – Writing and executing code.
•	Testing – Detecting and fixing defects.
•	Deployment – Making the software available for use.
•	Maintenance – Providing updates and enhancements.
4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i.	Waterfall
•	 It works best for projects with clear and fixed requirements, such as banking or government systems.
•	 Changes are difficult to implement once the project has started.
ii.	Agile
•	It allows for continuous feedback and adjustments throughout the development process.
•	Agile is suitable for projects requiring frequent updates, such as mobile apps and startup software.
•	While Agile is more adaptable, it requires active participation from stakeholders and strong project management.
5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
•	Software Developer – Codes, debugs, and maintains software.
•	Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software to ensure it meets quality standards.
•	Project Manager (PM) – Manages team coordination, deadlines, and project scope.
6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
•	Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) facilitate coding by providing debugging tools, syntax highlighting, and automation features (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
•	Version Control Systems (VCS) enable tracking code changes, collaboration, and rollback features (e.g., Git, GitHub, GitLab).
7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
•	Changing Requirements – Adopt Agile methodologies for flexibility.
•	Complex Debugging – Write modular, well-documented code.
•	Tight Deadlines – Utilize project management tools like Jira or Trello.
•	Security Risks – Follow secure coding practices and conduct regular testing.
8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
•	Unit Testing – Tests individual software components.
•	Integration Testing – Ensures different modules function together properly.
•	System Testing – Verifies the software as a whole.
•	Acceptance Testing – Confirms software meets user expectations and requirements.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
1.	Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
•	Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining AI prompts to generate precise and meaningful responses.
2.	Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
•	Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."
•	Refined Prompt: "Provide a simple explanation of artificial intelligence, including its key applications in healthcare, finance, and customer service."
Why is the improved prompt more effective?
•	More precise – Clearly defines the topic (artificial intelligence).
•	More targeted – Focuses on specific domains (healthcare, finance, customer service).
•	More concise – Avoids ambiguity, making the request clearer for AI to process.
